## Requirements
- A service which can answer bid requests in OpenRTB made by the fake ad-exchange.
- A service which can have a way to pre-configure very basic ad campaigns (db, file-system or hardcoded) to bid with.
- The bidder should respect blocked IAB categories from the bid request.
- An ideal solution should run in docker environment with docker compose command and include a Dockerfile in the solution.
**Bonus point:** Capture some auction metrics, i.e distribution of bid requests per IAB category.

## Start with cleaning (always start with cleaning üßπ üòÅ )
`./clean.sh`

## Now let's run it
`./run.sh`

Now you will see how the system is sending bid requests and getting bid responses if necessary.

## Swagger
You can check the endpoints in swagger as well http://localhost:9095/swagger-ui.html
